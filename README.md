Welcome to the <strong>STELLA (Science and Technology Education for Land/Life Assessment) project.</strong> STELLA instruments are portable low-cost do-it-yourself (DIY) instruments that support science education, and outreach through scientific engagement, inquiry, and discovery while helping you understand Landsat better.

Landsat images are not just colorful and captivating, they are also precise spectral measurements that provide a scientific record of our planet.

But what exactly does that mean? And how does Landsat make these measurements?

Consider building a STELLA to find out for yourselfâ€¦

Once assembled, the STELLA DIY spectrometers <strong>Q, 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0</strong> versions can make 12 different spectral measurements the <strong>STELLA-Q2</strong> can make 18 different measurements from violet/blue portions of the electromagnetic spectrum out to near infrared regions (beyond our range of vision). The STELLA 1.1 and 2.0 versions can also make surface temperature measurements of emitted thermal infrared energy like Landsat.

STELLA instruments help students understand remote sensing technology, applications and the importance of sensor calibration, introducing them to the science of Landsat with a learn-by-doing approach.

With STELLA you can see how the spectral signature (or reflectance pattern) of a drought-stressed plant compares to a healthy one; how sediment-laden water differs from clear water; or how the temperature of a lush green field contrasts with an adjacent concrete sidewalk.

<strong>Note:</strong> Main STELLA website is undergoing some changes and the Helio and AQ STELLAs have been temporarialy taken down. You can download their files below.

The <strong>STELLA-AQ</strong>, once assembled, combines carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) monitoring capabilities in a user-friendly device.
